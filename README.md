# Encryption and Decryption with AES and RSA

> ##### Objective

>> The objective of this project is to implement AES algorithms’ modes of encryption and decryption, then analyze and present each mode of operation and their error propagation. Additionally, RSA will be compared with AES for encryption and decryption in terms of their respective time consumptions.

> ##### Introduction

>> The purpose of this project is to explore encryption and decryption techniques using AES and RSA.

>> This project is implemented in Python, and it leverages the pycryptodome library for AES encryption, while focusing on the implementation of different AES modes.
